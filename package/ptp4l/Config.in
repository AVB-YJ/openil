	help
	This software is an implementation of the Precision Time Protocol
	(PTP) according to IEEE standard 1588 for Linux. The dual design
	goals are to provide a robust implementation of the standard and to
	use the most relevant and modern Application Programming Interfaces
	(API) offered by the Linux kernel. Supporting legacy APIs and other
	platforms is not a goal.

	Features

	- Supports hardware and software time stamping via the Linux
	  SO_TIMESTAMPING socket option.

	- Supports the Linux PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) subsystem by using the
	  clock_gettime family of calls, including the new clock_adjtimex
	  system call.

	- Implements Boundary Clock (BC) and Ordinary Clock (OC).

	- Transport over UDP/IPv4, UDP/IPv6, and raw Ethernet (Layer 2).

	- Supports IEEE 802.1AS-2011 in the role of end station.

	- Modular design allowing painless addition of new transports and
	  clock servos.
